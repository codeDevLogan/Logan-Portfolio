# Logan-Portfolio

## Description
I wanted to build an online presence for my developer abilities. So I decided to build a portfolio. This solves the problem potential employers might run unto of trying to find all about my developer past this saves them the trouble of hunting things down. I learned quite a lot by building this webpage fronm scratch. A lot of do's and a lot of don't's as it were. This project will be ever evolving and continiuing as I progress as a developer or at least until I am happy with it.
